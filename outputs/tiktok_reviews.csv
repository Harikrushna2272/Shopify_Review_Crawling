1,Exodus Beauty,"**This platform has been incredibly frustrating.**

I connected the TikTok app to my Shopify store—which was already performing well—because I wanted to increase product visibility and direct customers to my Shopify store from TikTok (similar to FB&IG). I assumed that orders placed through TikTok would be managed via Shopify, but I was very wrong.

TikTok prioritises customer engagement on its app, which means it applies discounts and free shipping to sellers’ listings without giving sellers the option to opt in or out. After receiving two orders where customers were granted free shipping—despite my shipping profiles being correctly set up—I had no choice but to cancel the orders, as they were placed without any shipping fees being paid. The seller also bears the cost of free shipping, and deductions are made from your payout in 5 BUSINESS DAYS.

I initially thought the shipping setup was incorrect, so I contacted support. Upon further investigation, I discovered that TikTok had automatically listed all my products at 40% off, with free shipping on orders over £22. None of these settings were configured on my end. I strongly believe that sellers should have full control over what discounts and offers are applied to their products/services.

Additionally, having shipping managed through TikTok’s platform added unnecessary steps to my existing Shopify fulfilment process, complicating operations that were already running smoothly.

These are my personal views, but ultimately, I chose to deactivate my TikTok store. Based on this experience, I don’t believe selling on the platform is currently viable or profitable for my business—either now or in the long term.","November 13, 2025",United Kingdom,About 4 years using the app

UPDATE: Finally, somehow, got it stop rejecting our documents. Running a shop has been a nightmare as well, with random AI false flagging out items as prohibited (they definitely are not) and then tickets/a support system that ranges from computer-generated worthless and agents that lack the english/cultural understanding to understand how they have errored. Maybe 1 in 10 agents understands and attempts to fix things, but that fix is usually to escalate to a different team which will also error and then put us back to step 1. I might give it 2 star because at least we're making sales, but honestly, this app has wasted so much of my time and patience that i question whether the money we've made is even worth the hassle.

Not sure whats up. Ive looked them over, they look fine. Ive tried 10+ times with different unaltered documents, doesnt matter. Sometimes it just rejects it saying they cant verify with no mention of altering.

We've never had this issue with any other shops/platform.

Not sure if this is some system/ai/computer error or some kind of incompetence on the human side because no one responds to tickets/emails over there.

Buyer initiated refunds and returns are accepted and processed automatically with what feels like little regard from the Seller. Customer Service leaves much to desire. Any explanation of violations you might encounter and why they were applied are non-existent and it seems appeals of violations fall on deaf ears.

I get that it must be this way due to them trying to avoid fraud cases maybe? but it is a rather complicated set up and I am sure I am not the only store that is simply missing some setting somewhere that would be an easy thing to fix with a little assistance.

I am sure I could fix this shop violation easily as I am in fact a valid business with the proper paperwork and not a fraudster, but honestly this onboarding experience has taught me that this is not a selling partnership I want to pursue and I will stick to just marketing on TikTok which is an actual good experience.

It will not be possible to activate your TikTok Shopping feature at this time, however, we do hope to have a solution to this soon and will be rolling out our new and improved Shopify integration to all our clients.

2,Sculpd,"There are some BIG limitations of this app.

Firstly (and most importantly), you can only link one Shopify Shop to an Ad Account - which causes big headaches if you've got multiple stores (for example, one per country). By contrast, Meta lets you connect multiple Stores to a catalogue and select which markets they are for; which is a far superior solution than having to make lots of catalogues and ad accounts.

Secondly, there is no longer any support for TikTok Shop (i.e. users being able to buy directly inside the TikTok app). This integration was the only way that TTS made sense as a proposition, otherwise it's an incredibly manual and slow process and as a result it's not worth enabling. Again, this is a feature that Meta's Shopify app offers.

Lastly, TikTok doesn't support Supplementary Feeds - so if you wanted to add any additional information (custom labels, alt images etc) then it all has to be directly added to your Shopify - as you won't be able to add any further info within TikTok. This is a feature that, once again, Meta (and Google) offer in their integrations.

Hopefully they address these issues in the future, but in the meantime the app needs a lot of work to bring it into parity with their competitors.","Edited December 14, 2022",United Kingdom,Almost 2 years using the app
